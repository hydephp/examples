            Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by
            her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do:
            once or twice she had peeped into the book her
            sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
            conversations in it, &quot;and what is the use of a
            book,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;without pictures or
            conversations?&quot;
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as
            she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy
            and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a
            daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up
            and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white
            rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor
            did Alice think it so very much out of the way to
            hear the Rabbit say to itself, &quot;Oh dear! Oh
            dear! I shall be too late!&quot; (when she thought
            it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she
            ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it
            all seemed quite natural;) but when the Rabbit
            actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket,
            and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started
            to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
            had never before seen a rabbit with either a
            waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and,
            burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
            after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a
            large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
        </p>
        <p>
            In another moment down went Alice after it, never
            once considering how in the world she was to get out
            again.
